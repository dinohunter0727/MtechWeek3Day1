            <h1>Budget</h1>
            <p>
                Budgetting, the dumbest of all concepts. Like, why should I care how much money I have and how much I can and should spend?
                The whole thing seems very redundant to me, like if I have money I will just spend the money on whatever I want in the exact
                moment, like, thats what money is for.

            <h1>Checkbooks</h1>
            <p>
                Checkbooks? Like I havent even heard of those things but just thinking about them makes me sick honestly. Why on earth would
                I have a book full of checks??? Sounds like a ton of wasted space if you ask me. If I want to write out money to someone I just
                lend them my debit card. Its so much easier.
            </p>
            <p> 
                If your interested in borrowing my card, head on over to my patreon. The first patron to donate $2000+ will win a free day to use my debit card
                to buy whatever they want!
